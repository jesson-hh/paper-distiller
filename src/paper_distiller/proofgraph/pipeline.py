"""Orchestration pipeline: turn a paper's full text into a proof graph.

Public API:
- ``CoverageReport`` dataclass — summary of what was processed.
- ``build_graph_for_paper(store, paper_arxiv_id, full_text, *, paper_slug, llm,
                          depth="step") -> CoverageReport``
  Segments the text, runs the per-segment extraction+gate+self_check loop,
  writes nodes to the store, resolves references into edges, marks dangling
  refs as gaps, and returns a coverage report.
- ``maybe_build_graph(proof_store, paper_arxiv_id, full_text, *, paper_slug=None,
                      llm=None) -> CoverageReport | None``
  Gated by ``PD_GRAPH_DEPTH`` env-var (default off). Returns None when gating
  is off or ``proof_store`` is None. Never raises.

Design constraints (from spec §5):
- Idempotent: calls ``store.delete_paper_graph`` first so re-runs are clean.
- Abstain over fabricate: the grounding gate (inside ``extract_segment``) ensures
  fabricated nodes never enter the store.
- Gaps are surfaced explicitly (not silently dropped).
